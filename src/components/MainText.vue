        Hi! Iâ€™m a 1st year Computer Science PhD student advised by Kathleen Marchal
        at Ghent Univerisity and Olivier Gevaert at Stanford University. In my     
        research, I develop deep-learning models that process digital histopathology images 
        ("virtual microscopy") of cancer tissues in order to derive properties of clinical interest.
